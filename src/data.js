        "title":"Archipelago: Mapping the Islands of the Venetian Lagoon",
        "description":"In the early modern period, the network of islands encircling the Venetian lagoon served as capillary structures for the political, socio-economic, and cultural interests of the Serenissima. Scattered throughout the entire ‘gulf’ of Venice, these settlements were indispensable to the larger Venetian community as loci dedicated to the city’s food supply, spiritual places for religious communities, and centers for defense structures or public hospitals. The socio-political events that followed the fall of the Republic (1797) profoundly changed this understanding and totally altered the reading of the city as an organic entity that encompasses the watery ecosystem. In some cases, interventions significantly transformed the islands’ geographic configuration and functions. The Archipelago project aims to investigate the long-term history and transformation of the clusters of settlements scattered throughout Venice’s lagoon between the late fifteenth and seventeenth centuries through a systematic and geographic-based analysis. This combines historical and digital methods by employing a semantic research platform for mapping, visualizing, and exploring urban data over time.",

        "description":"Florentia Illustrata was established in 2018 by common agreement among its founding members in recognition of the necessity to work together to create a research platform to provide consolidated access to digital projects on Renaissance Florence. Using the rich archival resources of the city, each of these approaches to reconstructing the past have been exploring the potential of digital tools to expand and innovate the methods used in humanistic historical research. Building on the long tradition of cutting-edge research techniques that have been brought to bear on Florence’s singular documentary and material legacy, they will create a shared digital platform that enables an intensive analysis of complex interrelated historical phenomena that characterized the early modern city. As such, they will lay the groundwork for innovative studies that will be able to embed experiments in urban planning, architectural design, and artistic representation within the concrete social structures, historical experiences, and spatial mentalities of the city’s inhabitants.",

This research tool allows you to search for any of the drawings listed in the three editions (1903, 1938 in English; 1961, in Italian). Filters allow you to search Berenson’s information by artist, title (in English or Italian), location, and technique. Each entry includes key information from all three editions of Berenson’s text, as well as the current location, an image of the catalog page, and plates included in 1903; most entries also have links to museum webpages, including images. For information about how the data was prepared, how to use the site, and for background on Berenson’s scholarship, see the About page.",

If a chunk of text describes a person, place, event, or other kinds of entities, it can be manually linked to the URI of that entity, and vice versa. Other than pure textual annotations, the Semantic Digital Publishing allows users to also create complex annotations. Where the goal is the linkage between free text, RDF data, and images. In particular, this project links parts of two distinct documents, or to a region of an image that is displayed through an IIIF Viewer. ",

        "description":"Following the devastating flood of '66, Villa I Tatti became the Florentine Headquarters of CRIA (Committee to Rescue Italian Art), a task force made up of scholars anxious to preserve Florence's precious artistic heritage. Amidst the turmoil and with a deep sense of urgency, they organized both a vast fund-raising campaign and the shipment to Italy of emergency conservation materials along with a team of specialists to assess the situation and begin long-range planning for the recovery. Chaired by Jacqueline Kennedy, the Committee raised money through direct mail requests, ads, special exhibits of Italian art, fashion shows and cocktail parties, in addition to video appeals by famous figures such as Ted Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor. This online exhibition explores the valiant efforts of CRIA during the aftermath of the flood, and examines I Tatti's central role in the recovery.",

Aggregating images and metadata from various open-access museum collections and archives, interns will use these images to build computer vision models to classify groups of images and identify features that are visually similar. The resulting tool will serve to programmatically match artworks across collections, archives, and libraries across the world, as well as assist scholars when conducting research on specific artworks or visual themes. Applicants should have some prior experience with machine learning/computer vision tools and have a declared major/minor in Computer Science.",

        "description":"This exhibition presents the extant correspondence--nearly all unpublished--between Bernard Berenson and Yukio Yashiro. At the height of their fame they were among the most influential art historians in the West and in Japan, respectively. Today Yashiro is little known outside of his native country except for his monograph on Botticelli, published in English in 1925, now available on this website. Yashiro described his goals for the book in a remarkable letter from 1922 to Laurence Binyon: “I shall make clear what I, a man brought up in an artistic atmosphere utterly different from that of Europe, feel of Botticelli, that side of Botticelli which, as I think, was never, or perhaps very little, appreciated by European connoisseurs.”",
