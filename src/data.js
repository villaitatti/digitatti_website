        "description":"Metapolis aims to develop a digital research infrastructure to support scholarship in the humanities that seeks to geospatially reconstruct places throughout time. As an interactive map-based publication platform, it enables users to cross-pollinate archival, bibliographic and multimedia sources with interpretive research, allowing for their interlinking and visualization on a map. Built on top of ResearchSpace, an open-source Semantic Web research environment, it facilitates the reuse and publishing of Linked Open Data. A rich set of features support data enrichment with external knowledge bases such as VIAF, WikiData, Worldcat, and the Getty vocabularies. Designed both as a research and publication tool, the software allows groups of scholars from a wide range of humanistic disciplines to connect their research and augment each other's findings through the layering of historical maps, interlinking them to sources to allow users to build knowledge about the world and its history.",

Using the rich archival resources of the city, each of these approaches to reconstructing the past have been exploring the potential of digital tools to expand and innovate the methods used in humanistic historical research. Building on the long tradition of cutting-edge research techniques that have been brought to bear on Florence’s singular documentary and material legacy, they will create a shared digital platform that enables an intensive analysis of complex interrelated historical phenomena that characterized the early modern city. As such, they will lay the groundwork for innovative studies that will be able to embed experiments in urban planning, architectural design, and artistic representation within the concrete social structures, historical experiences, and spatial mentalities of the city’s inhabitants.",

        "description":"In the last half-decade, convolutional neural networks have radically transformed the ways in which computers are able to understand images, including the precise deduction of human poses and hand gestures. This project attempts to transfer these techniques to art history and historical anthropology, exploring live and depicted gestural practices in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Italy. In an \"operationalization\" of Michael Baxandall's famous comments on fifteenth-century Florentine annunciations, my project traces micro-gestural movements and temporalities in large collections of Christian iconography. Outputs from my project at I Tatti have included: “The Choreography of the Annunciation: Reverse Engineering Baxandall's Pictorial Plot” (conference paper with Peter Bell, at the Comité International d'Histoire de l’Art 2019); “Ikonographie und Interaktion. Computergestützte Analyse von Posen in Bildern der Heilsgeschichte” (journal article with Peter Bell, in Das Mittelalter 24:1, 2019) and \"Analyzing Gesture in Digital Art History\" (chapter in The Routledge Companion to Digital Humanities and Art History, ed.

        "description":"In the early modern period, the network of islands encircling the Venetian lagoon served as capillary structures for the political, socio-economic, and cultural interests of the Serenissima. Scattered throughout the entire ‘gulf’ of Venice, these settlements were indispensable to the larger Venetian community as loci dedicated to the city’s food supply, spiritual places for religious communities, and centers for defense structures or public hospitals. The socio-political events that followed the fall of the Republic (1797) profoundly changed this understanding and totally altered the reading of the city as an organic entity that encompasses the watery ecosystem. In some cases, interventions significantly transformed the islands’ geographic configuration and functions. The Archipelago project aims to investigate the long-term history and transformation of the clusters of settlements scattered throughout Venice’s lagoon between the late fifteenth and seventeenth centuries through a systematic and geographic-based analysis. This combines historical and digital methods by employing a semantic research platform for mapping, visualizing, and exploring urban data over time.",

        "title":"Building Baroque Rome under Pope Innocent X Pamphilj",
        "description":"No one would deny that the artist-patron relationship between Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Pope Urban VIII Barberini was one of the most innovative in the history of art and architecture. But the emphasis on celebrities overlooks a crucial part of the story of urban renewal in early modern Rome. In addition, it has led to the misconception that the patronage of Pope Innocent X Pamphilj pales in comparison to other seventeenth-century popes. Leone proposes a new paradigm that de-emphasizes singular relationships and programmatic themes and, instead, stresses architectural production and the mechanics of patronage. This approach suits the practices of Innocent X and his relatives, who harnessed a stable of creative and skilled architects, artists, and artisans to realize multiple building projects across Rome: Villa Pamphilj, Palazzo Pamphilj in Piazza Navona, Bernini’s Four Rivers Fountain, Palazzo Nuovo on the Campidoglio, the nave decoration of St. Peter’s, the nave of San Giovanni in Laterano. To study how Innocent X accomplished so much building in so little time—from the start of his pontificate in late 1644 until the Holy Year of 1650—Leone employs traditional art historical practices, the methods of microhistorians, and network visualizations created through digital technology. This combination allows for both the recovery of previously overlooked individuals and the macroscopic perspective of relationship patterns and social context in Innocent X’s architectural network. As a digital humanities fellow at I Tatti in spring 2018, Leone focused on the data and network analysis. This work is the basis of the article that will be published in fall 2020: Stephanie C. Leone and Paul A. Vierthaler, “Innocent X Pamphilj’s Architectural Network in Rome,” Renaissance Quarterly 73.3 (2020).",

Mapping Sculpture traces the movement of the materials of sixteenth-century Italian sculpture from sources such as mountains, caves, and rivers to storage areas, artists' workshops, early modern installation sites and private collections, and to current museum locations. Through spatial analysis, this project draws attention to the removal of materials from the natural environment and to the movement of materials and completed artworks. GIS tools are used to analyze the displacement of materials (in terms of volume and distance), and the fragmentation, disappearance, and duration of these materials at the locations that they inhabited over time. In its first iteration, the map visualizes data from a small group of sculptures associated with gardens near Florence, Italy. For instance, the marble for Michelangelo’s Slaves was quarried near Carrara, and four of those blocks remained in the Boboli Gardens for more than three centuries; Ammannati’s multi-block Juno fountain, which was made of Campiglia marble, had constituent parts sent to various Medici villas during the same period. The interactive map will allow users to interrogate the relationships between geological and geographical origins and various subsequent locations, such as these gardens. By visualizing the spatial and material history of sculptures, the map encourages users to critically evaluate the environmental consequences of early modern artistic practices.",

This first phase of an interactive open source platform will utilize digital mapping and networking visualizations to provoke questions that disrupt modern conceptions of gender and place through these women’s material and spatial record. Motivating and anchoring this discussion is the work of cultural geographers who claim that culture is spatial, that space is ideological, and that we can discover issues of power, identity, and social regulation within landscape. Mapping the Medieval Woman will allow us to visualize how a woman could strategically situate herself and her commissions, move her objects in a deliberate design to build her identity, and, ultimately, create a lasting legacy for herself and her family. Through digital mapping we can recreate these women’s topographic relationships to the landscape by locating their domestic, urban, and beneficent architectural commissions such as residences, gates, bridges, hospitals, and chapels. In addition, we can trace the ceremonies and processions that provided a moving backdrop for the women and the larger populations of nations and court. Network visualization will also track the trajectories of the objects – gemstones, exotic materials, jewelry, tableware, reliquaries, small-scale sculpture, clothing, and manuscripts, to name a few – they commissioned, collected, and gave away across the larger landscape of Europe and the Mediterranean. Such networks suggest that elite women had a different type of territory, one not delineated just by borders but defined also by relationships.",
